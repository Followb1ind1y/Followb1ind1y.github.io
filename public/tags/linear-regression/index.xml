This method is mostly used for forecasting and finding out &lt;strong>cause and effect relationship between variables&lt;/strong>. Regression techniques mostly differ based on the number of independent variables and the type of relationship between the independent and dependent variables. Regression problems usually have one continuous and unbounded dependent variable. The inputs, however, can be continuous, discrete, or even categorical data such as gender, nationality, brand, and so on.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
